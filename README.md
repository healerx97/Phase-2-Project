**Travel Haven**


This project implements the Google Places, Nearby Search API to generate a travel brochure for any location keyword. Simply type a location in, and shortly wait for a colorful moodboard that starts off the brochure with several key locations elaborated in more detail in the pages behind. With a frontend created with React.js and backend created with json-server, the project highlights an extremely simple, yet powerful user experience.
